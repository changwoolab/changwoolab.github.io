**Partition with Grids and predict bounding boxes per Grid**

How to implement Grids? → ConvNet!

## 1. Architecture

1. Divides input image into S x S grid
2. Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes and confidence scores for those boxes
    
    $$
    Confidence=P_r(Object)*IOU^{truch}_{pred}
    $$
    
    - No object → 0
    Else → we want it to equal to IOU between predicted box and ground truth
    - Bounding box consists of 5 predictions: (x, y, w, h, confidence)
3. Each grid cell predicts C conditional class probabilities
    
    $$
    P_r(Class_i|Object)
    $$
    
    - Only predicts 1 set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the number of boxes B
4. At test time, multiply conditional class probabilities and individual box confidence predictions, which gives class-specific confidence scores for each box
    
    $$
    P_r(Class_i|Object)*P_r(Object)*IOU^{truth}_{pred}=P_r(Class_i)*IOU^{truth}_{pred}
    $$

Each grid consists of B bounding boxes(Confidence, x, y, h, w) and C class probabilities

$$
(C_{b_1}, b_{1x}, b_{1y}, b_{1h}, b_{1w}, C_{b_2}, b_{2x}, b_{2y}, b_{2h}, b_{2w}, ...\ , c_1, c_2, ... \ ,c_n)
$$

## 2. Loss Function

<img src="/public/img/yolov1-4.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" width="100%" />

**Meaning of λ**

- Sum-squared error makes localization error equal to classification error → Not ideal
- Many grid cells doesn’t contain any objects → Makes confidence scores towards zero
- Remedy this with λ_coord and λ_noobj to increase loss from bounding box predictions and decrease loss from confidence predictions that don’t have objects.

**Meaning of 1**

$$
\mathbf{1}_{i}^{obj} = if \ object \ appears\ in\ cell\ i
\\
\mathbf{1}_{ij}^{obj} = jth\ bounding\ box\ predictor\ in\ cell\ i\ is\ responsible\ for\ prediction
$$

**Characteristics**

- Only penalizes classification error if an object is present in that grid cell
- Only penalizes bounding box coordinate error if that predictor is responsible for the ground truth box

## 3. Advantages of YOLO

1. Extremly fast because it is just a regression problem and doesn’t need complex pipeline
2. Reasons globally about the image when making predictions
3. Learns generalizable representations of objects

## 4. Limitations of YOLO

1. Can predict limited number of nearby objects because each grid cell only predicts B boxes.
2. Struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual aspect ratios or configurations
3. Loss function treats errors the same in small bounding boxes vs large bounding boxes
    - Small error in a large box is generally benign but a small error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU
