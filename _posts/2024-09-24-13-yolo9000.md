## Summary

- YOLOv2 = Adds several techniques to YOLOv1
- YOLO9000 = Uses WordTree for semi zero-shot detection

## YOLOV2

1. **Batch Normalization**
2. **High Resolution Classifier**
    1. First fine-tune classification network with ImageNet
    2. Fine-tune resulting network on detection
3. **Conv with Anchor boxes**
    
    Removed FC layers from v1 and use anchor boxes
    
4. **Dimension Clusters**
    
    Instead of choosing anchor boxes by hand, use k-means clustering on the training set bounding boxes.
    
    K-means clustering? = grouping into k similar clusters by distance
    
    How does this paper define distance metric? 
    → want to make good IOU scores which is independent of the box size
    
    $$
    d(\text{box},\ \text{centroid})=1-\text{IOU}(\text{box},\ \text{centroid})
    $$
    
    Why does this lead to good results?
    → Because it starts the model off with a better representation, it makes task easier to learn
    
5. **Direct location prediction**
    
    When using anchor boxes, model became unstable because any anchor box can end up at any point in the image, regardless of what location predicted the box
    
    $$
    x = (t_x*w_a)-x_a\\
    y = (t_y*h_a) - y_a
    $$
    
    Solution → Predict location coordinates relative to location of grid cell
    
    Network predicts bounding box (5 t’s)
    grid cell’s location offset (cx, cy)
    Bounding box prior width, height (pw, ph)
    
    $$
    b_x=σ(t_x)+c_x\\
    b_y=σ(t_y)+c_y\\
    b_w=p_we^{t_w}\\
    b_h=p_he^{t_h}\\
    Pr(\text{object})*\text{IOU}(b,\text{object})=σ(t_o)
    $$
    
6. **Fine-Grained Features (Passthrough Layer)**
    
    Implemented passthrough layer that concatenates higher resolution features with low resolution features.
    
7. **Multi-Scale Training**
    
    Non-fixed input image size
    
8. **Darknet-19**
    
    Changed VGG models to learn faster.
    3x3 filters / doubled # of channels / 1x1 filters for compressing / batch normalization …
    

## YOLO9000

### Motivation

- Data is scarce so that it is hard to scale detection model
→ Harness existing classification data and use it to expand the scope of detection systems

### Idea

Joint training on both detection and classification data

1. Detection data → Full backpropagation
2. Classification data → Partial backpropagation only for classification specific parts

### How to jointly train? → Hierarchical classification

1. Make WordTree with WordNet
2. Dataset combination with WordTree

3. Perform classification with WordTree
→ Predict conditional probabilities at every node for probability of each hyponym of that synset given that synset
